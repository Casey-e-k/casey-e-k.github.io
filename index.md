# About Me

Hi! My name is Casey and I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Engineering Physics with a minor in Astronomy from the University of British Columbia. I have been fascinated with space since I was a child and my dream is to one day go to space. I was a Zenith Fellow Intern in the class of 2024 of the Zenith Canada Pathways Foundation's Zenith Fellowship:

My driving forces are curiosity, passion, and determination, and I enjoy hands-on work and collaborative work. I am a keen learner and a creative problem solver, and I am eager to expand my network and spread my wings in the space industry.
