•	Used analog and digital elements including op amps, transistors, counters, and a DAC to build a circuit capable of setting and actively controlling the speed of an electric motor. \
•	Tools used were an Analog Discovery 2, Digital Multimeter, Waveforms software, MATLAB, and all the above-mentioned circuit elements, as well as a 7-segment display. \
•	Gained meticulous and tenacious circuit debugging skills, intuition, and knowledge of all the sub-circuits, and an ability to create complex planar circuits and maintain an organized breadboard.
