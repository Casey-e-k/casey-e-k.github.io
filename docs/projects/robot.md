* Designed and built an autonomous robot capable of racing a real-life Mario Kart course with mystery blocks to collect, bombs to avoid, bananas to drop, and several shortcuts and obstacles. 
* The robot was optimized to drive fast and execute all functions without reducing speed. 
* Features: robot arms for block pickup, printer-style banana release mechanism, front wedge to constrain blocks and bombs, tape following capabilities, hall-effect sensor bomb detection, home-made pendulum ramp detection. 
* Skills developed: circuit design, mechanical design, soldering, prototyping, debugging code, troubleshooting electrical issues, optimizing designs, integrating electromechanical systems.
