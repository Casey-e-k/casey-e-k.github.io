# _(cut down later and needs editing, add details, photos, code links etc)_

# DC Generator - Physics 12 Project
* A project with the goal of researching a topic of interest not covered in class, self-teaching, and
building a functional physical device to demonstrate the chosen concept.
* Collaborated with a partner to research and self-learn the electromagnetic concepts of DC generators.
* Designed and prototyped a homemade, wind-powered DC generator including hand-wound coils of
magnetic wire.
* The generator could produce measurable electricity when powered by a hairdryer.

# Cardboard Chair - APSC 100 Project
Collaborated with a team to research, design, and construct a cardboard chair that was comfortable, aesthetically
pleasing, easy to disassemble and reassemble, and could support twelve sandbags

# Rainwater Harvester - APSC 101 Project
Collaborated with a team to design an excel-based model and general proposal of a small community water
treatment system and a rainwater harvesting system of our own design.

# Protected Bike Lane - APSC 100 Project
Collaborated with a team to create and deliver a proposal for a new City of Vancouver protected bike lane.

# Autonomous Claw - APSC 101 Project
* A team project and competition to build an autonomous claw capable of picking up, transporting, and
releasing objects of varying size, shape, and weight.
* Worked with a team to design and build the claw and Arduino housing unit, test the claw, and adjust
specifications in the code.
* The claw received an overall score of 95%

# Solidworks Keychain - APSC 100 Project
Modelled a miniature version of the UBC Clock Tower. On top of the tower, there was a Volkswagen buggy with a
raised E on each side.

# Ball Launcher - Physics 11 Project
Designed and constructed an adjustable trajectory ball launcher which performed well in a competition.

# Spaghetti Bridge - Physics 12 Project
Collaborated with a partner to research, design, and construct a bridge made of spaghetti and hot glue which
supported sixteen times its own weight, winning first place in competition.

# Simon Game - APSC 160 Project
* An individual project with the purpose of programming a playable memory game on an online
Arduino simulator using C/C++.
* Programmed LED blinking sequences to signal the start, reset, and win or lose conditions of the game.
* Randomly generated one of 4 numbers to indicate which light would blink next and programmed the
Arduino to wait for the user to press a button before continuing.
* The game ends and resets when the user guesses incorrectly or wins a set number of rounds.

# Machined Cell Phone Holder

# Adaptive Device - APSC 100 Project
Used Solidworks to individually design a model of an adaptive device intended to help quadriplegic patients
independently open screw-cap bottles.

# N-Grams, Autocompletion, and Gender Bias - CPEN 221 Project
* An object-oriented programming project in Java with the purpose of implementing data types to
analyze Rate My Professor reviews and categorize them based on rating, keywords, and gender.
* This project involved writing our own test suites and working with Git version control.
* Another aspect of the project involved using autocompletion for searches using keywords contained
in the reviews and creating a histogram chart and producing a graph displaying the data analyzed.

# Graphs, Games, and Interplanetary Travel - CPEN 221 Project
* An object-oriented programming project in Java with the purpose of implementing abstract data
types to create graphs using adjacency lists and adjacency matrices, and working with interfaces.
* While implementing the Graph class, I deciphered Dijkstra’s Algorithm to write a method to
determine the shortest possible path through a graph.
* The shortest path method was implemented, amongst others, for the application of this project which
was a game involving Han Solo and Chewbacca searching the galaxy for a missing ship and collecting
spices with a limited tank of fuel.

# Audio Editing Software Projects
Used Logic Pro X and Audacity to record, edit, and produce several audio pieces
including original songs, a YouTube video intro jingle, and an electric guitar cover of the Schindler’s List
theme.

# Film Editing Software Projects
imovie and what i made...
