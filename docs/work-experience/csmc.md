**_note: since finishing my internship at CSMC, they have rebranded as the Canadian Strategic Missions Corporation_**

As CSMC's Engineering Intern, I had the opportunity to work on 4 different projects. One of these projects even enabled me to take on the role of a **visiting research intern at Concordia University's Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science under Dr. Melanie Hazlett**, Associate Professor and Undergraduate Program Director for Chemical and Materials Engineering. My work on these will be outlined below:

## CSMC's Hydro+ Project as Dr. Melanie Hazlett's Visiting Research Intern
HYDRO+ is an In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technology aimed at producing water from lunar regolith on the moon. This project was funded by the Canadian Space Agency as part of their Lunar Surface Exploration Initiative. 

I spent 8 months working in Dr. Melanie Hazlett's lab at Concordia Univeristy as a representative from CSMC. I spent the first several months learning as much as I could from her PhD student Azam Movasati about lab safety and proper etiquette, how to operate lab equipment and construct reactor systems, and how to run experiments in a chemical engineering lab. During this time I performed experiments in a small scale packed bed reactor under her supervision. Eventually I took over running the Hydro+ experiments and was responsible for preparing samples, running experiments, collecting data (including performing Gas Chromatography), documentation, sample collection, and cleanup.

About 4 months in, Azam and I worked together to build a new, scaled up reactor systerm for the next phase of the project and after this I was fully responsible for the lab setup and all experimental activities. This included:
* adapting experimental procedures for the scaled up system
* performing any modifications and troubleshooting of the reactor and its equipment
* troubleshooting any operational challenges
* ensuring proper safety precautions are taken at each stage of activity
* conducting all lab activities, including but not limited to:\
  * sample preparation
  * loading/unloading and handling large reactor elements
  * performing reactions
  * operating lab equipment
  * data collection throughout the experiment
  * cleaning the lab equipment
* Writing a user guide for the system
* Creating training materials including a knowledge transfer document and instructional videos

Near the end of my internship I also had the **opportunity to train** a coworker and new PhD student to take over from me. This included passing on the knowledge I learned from Azam and teaching them about:
* lab safety and procedures
* how to run the Hydro+ experiemnts
* how to operate the lab equipment and collect data
* tips and tricks for troubleshooting equipment
* etc...

I also had many opportunities to creatively solve problems such as finding inventive ways to handle sample extraction when samples got stuck in the tubes, developing careful sample unloading procedures

Lab equipment and procedures I gained experience with:
* transporting and replacing gas tanks
* operating/using gas tanks
* a hydrogen generator
* mass flow controllers
* thermocouples
* gas chromatography
* fume hoods
* an FTIR (minimally)
* furnaces heated to over $$1000^\circ C$$
* heating tape and fiberglass high temperature insulation tape
* leak testing
* swaging ferrules onto tubing
* packing quartz wool
* condenser systems
* pressure regulators and flow valves
* troubleshooting gas lines
* routing tubing
* handling hazardous samples and materials
* ph strips
* electrolysis cell

As part of my work, I also had the opportunity to demonstrate this technology to representatives from the Canadian Space Agency as well as take part in a video demonstration which was sent to Gerald B. Sanders, Lead of ISRU at NASA.

Part of this demonstration involved simulating excavation strategies for lunar regolith and I was responsible for building a model excavator for this. The excavator didnt turn out to be strong enough for our demonstration purposes so I took the initiative to test and develop my own design using the provided parts. I'm proud to say my design was strong enough to use for the demonstration.

Training courses I completed:
* Corrosive Substances
* Hazardous Materials Minor Spill Response
* Hazardous Waste Disposal Training for Lab Personnel
* Introduction to Transport of Dangerous Goods
* Laser Safety Training
* Radiation Safety - Sealed Sources and X-Ray Devices
* Safe Handling of Nanomaterials
* Safe Storage of Hazardous Materials
* WHMIS for Laboratory Personnel

## Swarm Construction

I led CSMC and Mission Control's partnered swarm construction project which was funded through NGen Canada's Moonshot for Mining Minerals and Manufacturing program. As part of leading this project, I was responsible for:

* conducting a broad scope, in depth literature review on construction methods. This review, including proposals, was ~80 pages (special thanks to one of my coworkers for assisting me).
* leading a team to:
  * research and develop advanced concepts for ISRU and swarm robotics with construction applications for both the moon and Earth
  * design high level payload systems for lunar rovers, taking into account vacuum conditions, electrostatically charged lunar dust, and other lunar conditions
* developing technology timelines and process flow diagrams for my team's designs
* presenting my work to company leadership (including former NASA astronaut and commander of the ISS Drew Feustel), our partners at Mission Control, and developing a presentation for NGen Canada's representatives.

## Lunapure

LunaPure is CSMC's response to the CSA and Impact Canada's Aqualunar Challenge. This challenge was a call for technologies to purify lunar water in order to provide drinking water and water to grow food with on the moon. Lunapure is a sustainable system to purify lunar water from the lunar polar regions.

My contributions to this project involved prototyping parts of the system and performing experiments with the Lunapure process in order to help develop the technology.

Lab equipment and procedures I gained experience with:
* dry ice
* hot plates
* handling ammonia solutions
* ph testing

## Sustainable Copper Oxide for Lunar Applications

CSMC also partnered with Destiny Copper as part of NGen Canada's Moonshot for Mining Minerals and Manufacturing program on this project. The project is focused on sustainably producing high purity copper and copper powder from mine tailings. My work involved experimenting with the produced copper.

Lab equipment and procedures I gained experience with (in addition to what I learned through my reserach intern work):
* vacuum sealer
* handling messy samples in a fume hood
