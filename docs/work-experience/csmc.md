# CSMC

As CSMC's Engineering Intern, I had the opportunity to work on 4 different projects. My work on these will be outlined below:

## Hydro+
HYDRO+ is an In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technology aimed at producing water from lunar regolith on the moon.

I spent several months working in Dr. Melanie Hazlett's lab at Concordia Univeristy learning from her PhD student Azam Movasati about lab safety and proper etiquette, how to operate lab equipment and construct reactor systems, and how to run experiments in a chemical engineering lab. During this time I performed experiments in a small scale packed bed reactor under her supervision.

Eventually I took over running the Hydro+ experiments and was responsible for preparing samples, running experiments, collecting data (including performing Gas Chromatography), documentation, sample collection, and cleanup. Azam and I worked together to build a new, scaled up reactor systerm for the next phase of the project and after this I was fully responsible for the lab setup and all experimental activities. This included:
* adapting experimental procedures for the scaled up system
* performing any modifications and troubleshooting of the reactor and its equipment
* troubleshooting any operational challenges
* ensuring proper safety precautions are taken at each stage of activity
* conducting all lab activities, including but not limited to:\
  * sample preparation
  * loading/unloading and handling large reactor elements
  * performing reactions
  * operating lab equipment for data collection

I also had many opportunities to creatively solve problems such as finding inventive ways to handle sample extraction when samples got stuck in the tubes, developing careful sample unloading procedures

Lab equipment and procedures I gained experience with:
* gas tanks
* a hydrogen generator
* mass flow controllers
* thermocouples
* gas chromatography
* fume hoods
* an FTIR (minimally)
* furnaces heated to over $1000^\circ C$
* heating tape and fiberglass high temperature insulation tape
* leak testing
* swaging ferrules onto tubing
* packing quartz wool
* condenser systems
* pressure regulators and flow valves
* troubleshooting gas lines
* routing tubing
* handling hazardous samples and materials
* ph strips
* electrolysis cell


## Sustainable Copper Oxide for Lunar Applications

Lab equipment and procedures I gained experience with:
* vacuum sealer


## Lunapure

Lab equipment and procedures I gained experience with:
* dry ice
* hot plates
* handling ammonia solutions
